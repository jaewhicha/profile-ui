                            At Pariveda Solutions I am an Associate II and my current role is Lead Software 
                            Engineer for a team of Pariveda developers at EDF Energy North America. I communicate with 
                            my stakeholders directly and lead a small team with other cross-functional engineers to develop 
                            new features based on product requirements. The current project I work on revolves around a 
                            modernization of a pricing application for prospective customers. Previously, I've 
                            worked on a product that allows a better online car buying experience with a major automotive 
                            manufacturer and their dealers.

                            My expertise resides in the full stack of web engineering and I am well versed in multiple 
                            frameworks. I am a ninja when it comes to turning requirements and compositions into 
                            intuitive, robust, and scalable web applications. I have extensive knowledge of client-side 
                            frameworks, libraries, and tools such as Angular, React, RxJS, Redux, and Vue.js. 
                            Additionally, I have experience implementing RESTful web services using robust frameworks such 
                            as .NET Core, Spring Boot, and Express within Docker containers as well as database experience using MS SQL Server, 
                            PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Addtionally, I have worked almost exclusively within the top three major cloud platforms. 
                            My goal is to continue to gain more knowledge in the entire stack in order to become an architect in the world of web applications.
